Design Approach:

For this project, we wanted to create something unique and visually distinct. Our initial drafting and brainstorming after constructing the kit surrounded the idea of a 1960's Volkswagen Bettle.
Further modification and design of our car surrounded this goal, with the final product differing greatly from the original kit in several ways.

Kit Reverse Engineering:

Our process began with reverse engineering the exisiting baseplate and components. The dimensions and holes of the plate were measured using a caliper and verified against the components themseleves
to ensure dimensional accuracy. Rough exlusion zone models of the components themselves were then modeled and placed on the baseplate as they were on the car. As seen below, this gave an rough but
accurate digital representation of the car which could be used for further modifications.

Bettle Shell:

We then moved to finding a model of a Volkswagen bettle, making the determination that it would be easier to shift around and modify components of the car as opposed to customizing the difficult to 
modify mesh (.stl, .obj) files that we could find models of the Beetle in. After importing, processing, and scaling the shell of the car, we put the both the shell and the digital model of the unmodified
baseplate into an assembly to better determine how they demensionally related to each other, as can be seen below.

Baseplate Modifications:

After investigating the relationship between the car kit and our Beetle shell, we began the process of modifying the baseplate and shifting components around to better fit our shell. As can be seen
below, the design underwent several iterations and tests.

The final design of the baseplate, pictured below, encorporats all original components and electronics required for the car kit in a custom orientation. The baseplate was also analyized and lightened
for weight optimization, as weight was a future concern when adding a complete Beetle shell on to the vehicle. For the purposes of the CAD design, all holes were easily chained together in a sketch and
could be further modified if need be. They were also digitally color codded to assist assembly and reduce confusion.

Final Assembly:

Once the final baseplate design was finalized, it was 3D printed out of black recycled PLA with high wall count to incrase stiffness. The components of the car were assembled on the new plate, and
tested to ensure functionality. The block CAD model of the new component placement can be seen below.

Soon after the final model of the beetle shell was also completed and sent to production, also in black recycled PLA. Later on, it would be spray painted into the bright yellow seen on our finished
project. Interference, mounting, and structure were accounted for and a consideration when adding the shell to the baseplate in CAD before it was manufactured and integratd.
