Welcome to the central page for group 8's ENGR 1000 final project.

In this repository you can find:
- Full code running on the robot
- CAD of several iterations of the robot design
- Our technical design notebook detailing reasons behind our decisions
- Photos of our process and of the final product

We were given the following information and guidlines with which to complete this project:

Line Following Robot Guidelines
- Your total cost must not exceed $50—this includes the base kit.
- Your robot will be following a fairly complex line for the final project and compete against other robots to get to the end of the line the fastest. May the best robot win!
- Try different line configurations and test your robot under different conditions, including its ability to navigate around obstacles.
- You will receive poster guidelines during week 13 of lecture.
- It may be helpful to take pictures of your materials prior to assembly—if you did not do so and you already started, don’t worry. But if you haven’t, they could end up being helpful to add to your poster.
- If you need help, see the Evening Office Hours announcement and stop by one (or a
few) of our sessions

Deliverables:

a. Students must build the kit, code it to be able to detect and follow a black line on the ground, and modify it based on the below goals.

b. Participate in a line following competition at the end of semester against other teams

c. A poster that highlights your progress and final design

Goals:
Speed: There will be a competition at the end of the project to see whose robot can follow the line fastest
Aesthetics: Modify the robot design to make it more aesthetically appealing
Budget: Groups cannot go over a certain price point to modify their robot. ($28 for the base robot kit, about $2 to $5 for additional IR sensors;
